                    <h1 id="Access-Bars"><a href="#Access-Bars" class="headerlink" title="Access Bars"></a>Access Bars</h1><p>Access Bars® has assisted thousands of people to change many aspects of their body and their life including sleep, health and weight, money, sex and relationships, anxiety, stress and so much more. At worst you will feel like you have just had a phenomenal massage. At best your whole life can change into something greater with total ease.</p>
<p>There are 32 bars of energy that run through and around your head that connect to different aspects of your life. We call all of the points you touch when using this modality “The Bars.”</p>
<p>They store the electromagnetic component of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions and beliefs that you have ever had about anything.</p>
<p>For example; every thought you have ever had about money that you considered important, the energy of that thought is stored in the Bar called “money.”</p>
<p>There are Bars for healing, body, control, awareness, creativity, power, aging, sex and money; 32 different ones in all. Each Bar corresponds with that aspect or area of your life that it is named.</p>
<p>Touch one Bar and you begin to clear away the energy locked up in that area or aspect of your life just by touching it. Add in touching another Bar and you not only get the “issues” from the first Bar, you also begin clearing the “issues” stored in that second Bar. As well you clear all the points of view about those two Bars in relation to eachother, allowing for exponential change.</p>
<p>Just by gently touching the Bars you effectively erase everything you have ever stored there. Just five minutes can erase 5,000 to 10,000 years of stored points of view. What is the value of erasing this bank of data you have stored all this lifetime, and every lifetime?</p>
<p>When you are functioning from preconceived points of view about what is possible in life, what is not possible in life, and have it rigidly defined of how the world works, you cannot be aware of anything that does not match that.</p>
<p>Each thought, idea, attitude, decision or belief that you have fixed in place solidifies the energy and limits your capacity to change anything in that area. You change the energy, you change how that part of your life shows up. What is the most simple and easy way to change energy? Get your Bars touched! When you do, something different can show up in your life with ease.</p>
<p>At worst you feel like you have just had the best massage of your life. At best your whole life can change into something greater with total ease. This is an incredibly nurturing and relaxing process, undoing limitation in all aspects of your life without any effort.</p>
